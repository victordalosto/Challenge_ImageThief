## Challenge - Image Thief

This script was developed for a learning challenge, where we had to develop an <strong>pseudo-malicious code</strong>.<br>
I developed an executable script that would be used in a flash disk that, once executed, would find all the images that it finds in the computer it is inserted and would copy all the images it finds in the flash disk <i>Output</i> folder.
